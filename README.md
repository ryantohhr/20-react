## Challenges

### Rock Paper Scissors 🪨 📄 ✂️ 

In this project, I focused on creating a simple rock paper scissors game, with 2 main screens:

1. Weapon Selection
2. Result

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS and Typescript, and served as an introduction to the syntax of these tools.

Takeaways:
- Typescript
  - State type declaration
  - Creating types
  - Usage of `as const` to specify types
- Tailwind
  - Basic syntax

### Stopwatch ⏱️

In this project, I created a browser stopwatch which allows the user to start, pause and reset the stopwatch.

Takeaways:
- React
  - Usage of `useRef` for tracking variables without triggering a rerender
  - Using `(prev) => prev + 1` to increment states
  - Conditional rendering with `&&`
- Typescript
  - Using type inference (Avoid redundant type declarations)
- Tailwind
  - Understood utility classes for styles like width and height

### Dice 🎲

Created a dice site that allows the user to roll a die.

Takeaways:

Relatively simple project, familiarised with syntax of involved technologies.

### Traffic Light 🚦

Created a traffic light display that switched between red, green and orange at set intervals.

Takeaways:
- React
  - Usage of `useEffect` to avoid side effects and state updates during rendering
- General
  - Using `const` and full caps for constant variables for readability and avoid accidental reassignment
  - Using conditional reassignment within `className` for cleaner code
