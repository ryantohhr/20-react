## Challenges

### Rock Paper Scissors

In this project, I focused on creating a simple rock paper scissors game, with 2 main screens:

1. Weapon Selection
2. Result

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS and Typescript, and served as an introduction to the syntax of these tools.

Takeaways:
- Typescript
  - State type assignment
  - Creating types
  - Usage of 'as const' to specify types
- Tailwind
  - Basic syntax
